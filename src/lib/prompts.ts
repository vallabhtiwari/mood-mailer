export const MOOD_PROMPTS: Record<string, string> = {
  FLIRT: `Craft an irresistibly charming and playful email that oozes confidence and wit. Your words should spark curiosity, leave the recipient smiling, and keep them wanting more. Use clever wordplay, subtle innuendos, and a teasing tone—never desperate, always smooth. Balance humor with a touch of mystery. Every line should feel like a wink. Be bold, be alluring, and make it impossible to ignore.`,
  POEMS: `Write an evocative, soul-stirring poem that captures raw emotion and paints vivid images. Use striking metaphors, lyrical language, and a rhythm that flows like a heartbeat. Let the words cut deep or uplift, depending on the mood—never vague or flat. This is not a greeting card; this is poetry that leaves a mark. Make it unforgettable. Make them feel it.`,
  RANT: `Deliver a fierce, unapologetic rant that pulls no punches. Dive headfirst into the frustration, outrage, or exasperation—no sugarcoating. Use sharp, biting language with a fast, relentless pace. Every sentence should hit like a hammer. Emphasize raw honesty with dramatic flair. Be loud, be brutal, and let the emotion rip through the page. No holding back—leave scorch marks.`,
  THERAPY: `Compose a calm, grounded, and deeply empathetic email that feels like a safe place to land. Your tone should be warm but firm—reassuring without being patronizing. Ask thoughtful questions to guide self-reflection. Acknowledge the complexity of emotions while offering practical, actionable support. Always validate feelings. This is not fluffy positivity—this is real, honest care. Give them the words they didn't know they needed.`,
  ROAST: `Write a savage, razor-sharp roast that playfully tears the recipient apart while keeping the tone hilarious and (mostly) good-natured. No weak jokes—deliver clever, cutting insults that sting but entertain. Use absurd exaggerations and hyperbolic mockery. Push boundaries without being mean-spirited. If they're not laughing (and a little offended), you're not doing it right. Aim for glorious, comedic destruction.`,
  YEARN: `Create a heart-wrenching, deeply passionate email that aches with longing. Every word should pulse with desire, bittersweet nostalgia, or unattainable hope. Use rich, sensory language that immerses the reader in the ache. Let the tension simmer beneath every line—whether it's love unspoken, a missed chance, or a soul craving connection. Make them feel the weight of what's missing. No clichés—just raw, beautiful yearning.`,
